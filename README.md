# Assignment 2 - SDN App Development

Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an architecture designed to manage and implement networks, using software-based controllers or application programming interfaces (APIs).

A difference with traditional networks, which use dedicated hardware devices (routers, switches) to control or manage the traffic and network configuration. SDN allows the creation of virtual networks or control hardware via software.

# Motivation

I decided to build a proof of concept of the dynamic nature of demand response solutions for the network, where depending on high demand changes we can redirect the network traffic to a specific port using the SND controller.

For a real implementation, a dynamic nature of demand response can dynamically reroute or prioritize data flows based on current network conditions and energy demands. For example, during peak demands, SDN can prioritize traffic related to critical services or adjust to different energy sources.

Overall, my motivation is how to optimize the use of energy in a multi-grid energy system.
